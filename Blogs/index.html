          <h5 class="card-title">Project: Calculator Site</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            When I hosted my Calculator Site on an AWS S3 bucket, I received two errors: favicon error and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Error.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time the Calculator Site's pages were loaded, I would get a favicon error. A favicon is the tiny picture shown on the 
            site's web browser tab. When I uploaded my site's files onto the S3 bucket, I didn't incorporate a favicon in my files. 
            Hence, there was no favicon shown on the Calculator Site's web browser tab and the favicon error was being shown on the 
            site's console.   
          </p>
          <p>
            To resolve the favicon error, I first found out what a favicon was and found a site that would convert a picture into a 
            standard favicon sized image. Since my site calculated the solution of quadratic equations and system of linear equations, 
            I wanted to make my favicon be a calculator. With this in mind, I picked my favorite calculator image on Google, 
            uploaded it to the favicon converter site, and downloaded the favicon sized calculator. With this favicon, I saved it in my repo 
            and linked it at the beginning of each of my Calculator Site's HTML5 files. Now, the tiny calculator favicon is shown on each of the 
            site's pages and the favicon error in the console is gone!
          </p>
          <p>
            On my Calculator Site, there is a page that simplifies expressions. Once you put an expression in the input box, it sends this input to an 
            to an external API which simplifies the input and sends back the simplified expression. Now this simplified expression that should have been 
            sent back from the external API was not being shown once the Calculator Site was hosted on an AWS S3 bucket. This page was working locally, 
            but for some reason was giving an SSL error every time the user tried to simplify an expression on the hosted site.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some research, I learned a url beginning with https had a Secure Socket Layer (i.e. SSL) certificate where as a url beginning 
            with http did not. This certificate allows information to be encrypted and makes the connections secure. Now the absence of this SSL 
            certificate raises a SSL error. 
          </p>
          <p>
            That is, when the user pressed the simplify button to simplify a given expression, the hosted site, whose url began with https, would call an 
            external API, whose url began with http. However, since this hosted site had a SSL certificate and called a site without a SSL certificate, 
            the SSL error was raised. For this reason, the request to simplify the given expression was not sent and no simplified expression 
            was shown on the hosted site's page.             
          </p>
          <p>
            When the user clicked the simplify button, it called the simplificationOnScreen function. This function was responsible for sending the given expression 
            to the external API and posting the external API's simplification on the hosted site. Within this function, I added a conditional statement that made sure 
            if the url that called the external API began with https, then the external API's url would also begin with https. Otherwise, it would call the external 
            API's url beginning with http. This way, the secure version of the hosted site would send and receive its response with https urls, the insecure version of 
            the hosted site would send and receive its response with http urls, and the files for the Calculator Site would work locally!

          <h5 class="card-title">Project: Sadia's Site</h5>
          <p class="card-text">After observing navigation examples on W3Schools and Bootstrap, I referenced the Bootstrap examples to build my navigation. 
            I added two dropdown menues to my navbar so that one could reflect all my HTML5 Canvas drawings and one could reflect my contact and website information.
          </p>
          <p>As I pushed my code to Sadia's Site and tested if the navbar and its dropdown worked to my satisfaction, I noticed that when the second
            dropdown was open it was getting cut off. It wasn't showing all four of the open dropdown's rounded corners.  
          </p>
          <p>To fix this issue, I inspected each element and attribute within the navigation, since the issue dealt with the navbar. 
            I noticed that one of the elements had the attribute `ml-auto`, and observed that when I used `mr-auto` instead, all the words on the navbar were left aligned.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I preferred `ml-auto`. If only I could keep my navbar words right aligned but shift them all slightly left so the entire second dropdown would show when 
            it's opened...but I could do this with some padding! Thus, in my CSS file, I added some padding on the right of the class `ml-auto`. 
            Now, both my dropdowns are entirely shown when they are open!

            and my Github and LinkedIn. However, everytime I tried to put in a footer, it would either go over the input boxes or the words on 
            my `About Me` page when the web browser window was extremely small. After trying out many footer templates, I finally found a sticky 
            footer on CSS-Tricks that worked. I played with all the CSS of this footer, and I concluded the main aspect that was missing from 
            all my previous attempts at making a footer was that I did not include a minimum height for the CSS selector main. Allowing the CSS 
            selector main's minimum height to be viewport height of 47 kept the footer at the bottom of both the `About Me` page and the pages 
            with user inputs. So be sure to have a minimum height for when your footer should begin on the page!
